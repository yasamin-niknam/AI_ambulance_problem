    "A* Search algorithm is one of the best algorithms used in graph traversals. It uses the steps token before and the estimation of future to make an estimation(called heuristic) for its next step.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "First, we define a frontier, in which we keep all the states that can be reached from now. Secondly, we define a measure called f, that is:\n",
    "$$ Node.f = Node.g + Node.h$$\n",
    "in which g is number of steps taken till now(distance) and h is the heuristic chosen for this problem.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We should note that our heuristic should be admissible and consistent. Otherwise it would not give us the optimal solution. To make sure that the answer is optimal, we check admissibility for every heuristic we suggest. Moreover, as we avoid having repeated states, it would not be necessary to check consistency.\n",
    "Admissible choices are heuristics that have the following condition:\n",
    "$$ h(n) \\leq h^*(n) $$\n",
    "where $h^*(n)$ is the true cost to reach the goal state.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For implementing this, we use two heuristics explained below:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The heuristic is the sum of minimum distances between patients and hospitals. In each state, the minimum distance needed to be taken to accomplish the goal, is to take every patient to his nearest hospital available. So this heuristic is les or equal to the actual distance(cost) and therefore, it is admissible due to its condition.\n",
    "$$ h(n) \\leq h^*(n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This heuristic can be implemented in two different ways. One with **Manhattan Distance** and the other with **Euclidean distance**.\n",
    "#### 3.1. Manhattan Distance \n",
    "*Manhattan distance* or *L1 distance* is a distance metric between two points in a N dimensional vector space. It is the sum of the lengths of the projections of the line segment between the points onto the coordinate axes. In simple terms, it is the sum of absolute difference between the measures in all dimensions of two points.\n",
    "$$L_1(x, y) = ||x-y||_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - y_i| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2. Euclidean Distance\n",
    "*Euclidean Distance* or *L2 distance* between two points in either the plane or n-dimensional space measures the length of a segment connecting the two points. It is the most obvious way of representing distance between two points.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Both heuristics are admissible and therefore, both of them give us optimal. But since a patient can be moved along the four cardinal diections and not diagonally, the **Manhattan Distance** would be more close to the real cost. As a result, **L1 Distance** is a better choice. "
